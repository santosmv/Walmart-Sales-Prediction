# Walmart-Sales-Prediction

Repository to analyse the time-series data from Walmart Inc found in [Walmart Sales Dataset of 45 stores](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/varsharam/walmart-sales-dataset-of-45stores/data). 

Some of the topics approached in the notebook are:

- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Autocorrelation
- Time Series Decomposition in seasonal, trend and noise
- Model training and tunning to predict Walmart's weekly sales

System to analyse the problem:

Create an automated system where the data is passed and the system finds the best ML, or statistical model (or unsemble), save the best model specifications in a database. Save best prediction in the database. Evaluations and predictions are shown in an app on the web browser with plots of:

- Prediction over training
- Prediction over test
- Two or more evaluation metrics changing for each running
- Prediction over all stores with subplots
- Training over a store and predicting over others with the same model
- Predict combined sales
- Other exploratory analysis features in the panel
